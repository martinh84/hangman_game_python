# hangman_game_python
A version of the popular word game, Hangman, on Python.  Created for my Stanford Code In Place 2021 course

Hangman is a game where a word is presented to the user in hidden form (underscore for each letter, e.g. hello == ______).
The user has a set number of guesses to spell out the word in full.  For each incorrect guess, the user will lose a life and the hangman image will slowly start to build.

I chose to use the console to play a simplistic version.  I dabbled with TKinter but will try that a little later, due to the time constraints on submitting a finished project.

I have used various techniques including: while, for and lists.
